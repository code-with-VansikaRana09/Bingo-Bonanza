# Bingo-Bonanza
Bingo Bonanza is a fun and competitive digital adaptation of the classic Bingo game, developed using Unity and C#. Designed with a 6x8 Bingo grid, the game features a dynamic Player vs AI mode where the player always starts first, but the outcome depends entirely on strategy and luck—whoever completes a row first wins!

Gameplay Highlights:

Player vs AI Mode: The player and AI take alternate turns. The AI is smart and unpredictable, ensuring every match is exciting.

Turn-Based Mechanics: Player starts first, but victory depends on who completes a row first—not on who begins.

Random Number Generation: Each turn generates a random number that must be marked on the player's or AI's grid.

Visual Feedback:

On number selection, the grid button color changes: green for player, red for AI.

A horn sound plays on wrong selection.

A celebration sound plays when a player or AI wins.

Tech Stack: Unity, C#
