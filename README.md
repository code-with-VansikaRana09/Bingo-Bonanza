# Bingo-Bonanza
Bingo Bonanza is a fun and competitive digital adaptation of the classic Bingo game, developed using Unity and C#. Designed with a 6x8 Bingo grid, the game features a dynamic Player vs AI mode where the player always starts first, but the outcome depends entirely on strategy and luckâ€”whoever completes a row first wins!

ðŸ§  Gameplay Highlights:

Player vs AI Mode: The player and AI take alternate turns. The AI is smart and unpredictable, ensuring every match is exciting.

Turn-Based Mechanics: Player starts first, but victory depends on who completes a row firstâ€”not on who begins.

Visual Feedback:

On number selection, the grid button color changes: green for player, red for AI.

A celebratory sound is played when someone wins.

Clicking a wrong number triggers a horn sound for instant feedback.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: Unity, C#
